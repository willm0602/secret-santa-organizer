# secret-santa-organizer
This is a script I wrote to organize a secret santa that would ensure nobody picks themselves.
To run this script, please do the following:
1) Install nodejs
2) Install the dependancy <a href = "https://nodemailer.com/usage/">node mailer</a>
3) Go into the script and remove the sample name for the people list and add another object containing a name and an email for each person participating
4) In the declaration of the emailClient variable, replace the login information with yours
5) In the sendEmail function, update the sample email.
6) In order for the email to be sent, you will need to turn off "less secure app blocked" in Gmail.
